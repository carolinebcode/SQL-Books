# TikTok Book Project 
My project analysis creating a database for a bookshop inspired by #BookTok books on TikTok

I used the hashtags of BookTok on TikTok to ascertain the most popular books on TikTok in 2023, Google to find my data on page length, author names and publication years and Goodreads for review statistics. I included features such as basic book information, the average Goodreads ratings, order information, price and sales in the previous 12 months.
